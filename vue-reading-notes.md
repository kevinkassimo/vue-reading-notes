# Vue Reading Notes

This is my own notes of reading the `vue-next` (Vue 3.0) source code. I am a React user and has never used Vue before, so I think it would be interesting to read through its source code while going through its docs and guide (especially that my understanding of virtual DOM is really hand-wavy).

Since the notes is only for my own benefit, it will be pretty disorganized, as I document fun things I find along the way.

### Entry

+ `Vue.createApp` is from `runtime-dom` pkg.
